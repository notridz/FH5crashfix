<h2 align="center">Forza Horizon 5 Crash Fix</h2>

<h2>How it works?</h2>
it's going to kill explorer.exe after it detects ForzaHorizon5.exe is running, and running it back after fh5 is closed. you can change the timer to kill the explorer the way you like by changing on the number on line <b>TIMEOUT /T 70 /NOBREAK<b>
<p><br>

<p>
<b>Keep in mind!</b><br>
  - you <b>can't</b> open any application since explorer is gone while forza is running<br>
  - you <b>can't</b> switch between windows (unless you have other monitors)<br>
  - if you're running dual monitor (or more), open other applications that you're going to use while playing and move it anywhere except your main monitor where forza would be,<b>BEFORE</b> you run the bat file<br>
</p>
